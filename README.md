# Bias-Aware-Dataset-Evaluation-Soft-Facial-Attribute-Recognition

This repository contains enhanced annotations for the CelebA and LFW datasets, developed in the context of the study:

**A Framework for Bias-Aware Dataset Evaluation in Soft Facial Attribute Recognition**  
Lucia Cascone, Michele Nappi, Chiara Pero, Xinggang Wang *(currently under review)*

These annotations are intended to support fairness and bias evaluation in soft facial attribute recognition (FAR) tasks.
